Troll Formatting Shell Script
===============

## No actual malicious activity is being performed!

### A troll shell script I wrote to play an innocent prank on my friends.  
It pretends that it formats your drives with a fake message and a fake progress bar.  
The link with the progress bar and spinner is available in the script as commments above the corresponding parts.  
The link with the progress bar and spinner can also be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38340073)!

### To run
- POSIX - \*NIX - GNU Linux
  - ```sudo chmod +x /path/to/troll.sh```
  - ```/path/to/troll.sh```

- Windows
  - ```sh /path/to/troll.sh```
